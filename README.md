# HollowKnight.Multiplayer
Welcome to my fork of multiplayer!


Planned features to add:
 - teams(25% added)
 - chat(70% added)
 - finish enemy sync(0% added)
 - PvP deathnmatch/team deathmatch(0% added, but should be easy to add)


after a feature is 100% complete, I'll update the github repository(or I will update it with my current progress when i get access to the pc with the multiplayer files on it)
